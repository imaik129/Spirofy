This is a repository containing the code for "Spirofy.com", a personal project I worked on to explore fun ways to visualize my spotify playlists! 

Spirofy allows you to visualize your spotify playlists as hypotrochoids and epitrochoids. The thickness, curve, size of each line corresponds to some data retrieved from the spotify API.

The code averages every song data in a playlist, and converts it to a number that can be rendered in the sprograph visualizer I created. 

You can also compare your playlist with an average Spotify Playlist via graphs.
